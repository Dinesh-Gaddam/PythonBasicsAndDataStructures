# PythonBasicsAndDataStructures
This project is about to get hands-on experience in using Python for building the fundamentals elements of computer programing

**CollectionsExample.py**
Play around arrays/stack/Queue/Deque/Tuple/Set /Dictionaries
The second part is the use of lambda expressions for filter data
The third Part is to loop through collections and sequence comparisons

**Recursive.py**
Use the classic Fibonacci series to play around recursive function

**Lesson1_PythonPracticeAssignment.py**
Declaration and usage of class , constructor(object initilization), usage of class property like array in adding the items and to access with self keyword

**Lesson2_LinkedList.py**
Build a single linked list by providing options like insert/apend/delete and print the elements of particular node

**Lesson2_Stack.py**
Build a stack( push/pop) using linked list 

**Lesson2_Quee.py**
Build a quee( enquee/dequee) using linked list 

**Lesson5_BinaryTree.py**
Binary tree : Intention is to build the search to find the element. Implemented pre order search with couple of iterations.

Binary Search tree: 
Search technique is implemented by Recursive fashion
Hard coded the order of node construction such that it forms Binary search tree.
Usage: Index builds in any relational databases like MS SQL

**SearchTechniques.py**
Yet to build
